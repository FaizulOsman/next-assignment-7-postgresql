## What is PostgreSQL?

**Answer:** PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its robustness and extensibility. It organizes data into tables, ensuring data integrity through ACID compliance. With advanced features like custom functions and data types, it's highly adaptable to various needs. PostgreSQL supports SQL queries, concurrency control, and high availability mechanisms. Its strengths lie in full-text search, triggers, and stored procedures, allowing complex data manipulation. It excels in security, offering authentication, role-based access, and encryption. It's widely used across industries for web apps, data warehousing, and more, competing with MySQL and Oracle. Released under its open-source license, it's actively developed by a vibrant community.
